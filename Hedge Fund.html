  <h3 id="What is a Hedge Fund?">What is a Hedge Fund?</h3>
  <p>A hedge fund is an investment fund created by accredited individuals and institutional investors for the purpose of maximizing returns and reducing or eliminating risk, regardless of market climb or decline. It is basically a private investment
    partnership between a fund manager and the investors of the fund, often structured as a limited partnership or limited liability company. The partnership operates with little to no regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
  <h3 id="What are the Main Hedge Fund Strategies?">What are the Main Hedge Fund Strategies?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Global macro strategies</strong></li>
    <p>In the global macro strategy, managers make bets based on major global macroeconomic trends such as moves in interest rates, currencies, demographic shifts, and economic cycles. Fund managers use discretionary and systematic approaches in
      major financial and non-financial markets by trading currencies, futures, options contracts, and traditional equities and bonds.</p>
    <li><strong> Directional hedge fund strategies</strong></li>
    <p>In the directional approach, managers bet on the directional moves of the market (long or short) as they expect a trend to continue or reverse for a period of time. A manager analyzes market movements, trends, or inconsistencies, which can
      then be applied to investments in vehicles such as long or short equity hedge funds and emerging markets funds.</p>
    <li><strong>Event-driven hedge fund strategies</strong></li>
    <p>Event-driven strategies are used in situations wherein the underlying opportunity and risk are associated with an event. Fund managers find investment opportunities in corporate transactions such as acquisitions, consolidations,
      recapitalization, liquidations, and bankruptcy. These transactional events form the basis for investments in distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations.</p>
    <li><strong>Relative value arbitrage strategies</strong></li>
    <p>Relative value arbitrage hedge fund strategies take advantage of relative price discrepancies between different securities whose prices the manager expects to diverge or converge over time. Sub-strategies in the category include fixed income
      arbitrage, equity market neutral positions, convertible arbitrage, and volatility arbitrage, among others.</p>
    <li><strong>Long/short strategies</strong></li>
    <p>Long/short equity is an investing strategy that takes long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long/short equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure while
      profiting from stock gains in the long positions, along with price declines in the short positions. Long/short equity works by exploiting profit opportunities in both potential upside and downside expected price moves. This strategy identifies
      and takes long positions in stocks identified as being relatively underpriced while selling short stocks that are deemed to be overpriced.</p>
    <li><strong>Capital structure strategies</strong></li>
    <p>Some hedge funds take advantage of mispricing of securities up and down the capital structure of one single company. For example, if they believe the debt is overvalued, then they short the debt and go long the equity, thus creating a hedge
      and betting on the eventual spread correction between the securities.</p>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="What are the Features of a Hedge Fund?"> What are the Features of a Hedge Fund?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Accredited Investors</em></strong>: Only qualified or accredited investors like banks, insurance companies and even high net worth individuals are allowed to invest in such funds.Certain net worth requirements need to be met by
      potential investors -- individuals with an annual income that exceeds $200,000 for the past two years or a net worth exceeding $1 million, excluding their primary residence. As such, the Securities and Exchange Commission deems qualified
      investors suitable enough to handle the potential risks that come from a wider investment mandate. </li>
    <li><strong><em>Wide Investment Latitude</em></strong>:A hedge fund's investment universe is only limited by its mandate. A hedge fund can basically invest in anything—land, real estate, stocks, derivatives, and currencies. Mutual funds, by
      contrast, have to basically stick to stocks or bonds and are usually long-only.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Risk Factor</em></strong>: Some of the hedge funds are exposed to a high risk which may lead to huge losses. The lock-in period is comparatively very high regarding other investment options.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Uses leverage</em></strong>: Hedge funds will often use borrowed money to amplify their returns.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Fee Structure</em></strong>: The fees of hedge fund managers are ‘Two and Twenty’, i.e. 2% is the fixed fees, whereas the manager takes 20% on the profit earned. This fee structure is quite high as compared to other investment
      options.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Tax Obligation</strong></em>: The hedge fund is not exempted from tax and is taxable on the grounds of the level of investment. This tax will not be borne by the unitholders.</li>
